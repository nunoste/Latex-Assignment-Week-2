	abstract = {Objective. This analysis examines whether differences exist between women and men state legislators in their roll-call voting behavior involving matters of economic and regulatory policy. Methods. Using interest group rating scores, I examine the voting behavior of representatives in the lower houses of 28 states in legislative sessions from 1995 to 2000. By controlling for a host of variables related to legislators (political party, years of service, etc.) and their districts (average income, level of education, urbanization, etc.), I am able to isolate the independent effect of gender on roll-call voting. Results. The findings demonstrate that among Democratic legislators women are less conservative than men, but among Republican lawmakers women are slightly more conservative than men. Additional analyses show that many factors that influence legislative voting by women and men are similar; however, political party has a more prominent effect among women. Conclusion. Although factors such as political party and some constituency characteristics exert a much stronger influence than gender, women and men legislators differ in their roll-call voting even when controls for a wide assortment of individual-and district-level conditions are taken into account.},

	abstract = {This research seeks to investigate key variables affecting low female political representation in the {US}. Although playing a leading role in promoting democracy and human rights in other countries, the {US} ranks low in female political participation than expected. For instance, New Zealand is similar to the {US} in political history and culture, demographic structure and gender ratio, and democracy level; however, it ranks higher in political representation of women than does the {US}. Arguably, existing literature on female political representation relies on three strands of explanations: socio-structural, culture-based, and institution-based. The findings in this research confirm the validity of the institution-based explanation. They suggest that political institution such as the electoral system is a crucial variable that can explain why the {US} ranks lower in female political representation than does New Zealand. The electoral system is also a key variable that can explain why female representation ratio in state legislatures in six particular states in the {US}—Vermont, Washington, Arizona, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Maryland—is higher than the rest. The research confirms that the mixed-member proportional system elects more women than the single-member district plurality system in the {US}.},

In this article, we investigate whether gender stereotypes transcend party. We consider whether gender stereotypes affect woman politicians differently by party and examine the effect of partisan identification on gender stereotypes. We find that the public perceives gender differences within both political parties. Thus the presence of the party cue does not preclude a role for candidate gender. However, we also find that the implications of gender stereotypes are somewhat different for Democratic and Republican women.},

This article brings together research on leadership effects in parliamentary elections and female candidate effects in legislative races. Ideological, structural, and situational differences between men and women have been used to explain gender gaps in voting. We explore an alternative explanation—gender identity. When women candidates are present, the gender identity hypothesis assumes that women voters are more likely to choose women candidates because of gender. While this hypothesis has been tested in legislative races, it has not been applied to party leaders in parliamentary elections. We test the gender identity hypothesis in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Britain. We find that leadership evaluations affect vote choice across all countries but the effects of gender and the combined effects of gender and leadership differ across countries.},

	abstract = {Objective. Research has established that female legislators act differently than their male counterparts in state legislatures. But the effect of gender on roll call voting is less clear, due in part to the fact that research has not properly differentiated between the multiple ways gender can influence roll call voting. Methods. In order to better understand the relationship between gender and roll call voting, structural equation modeling is used to examine roll call voting in numerous issue areas in five state legislatures. Results. Gender rarely exerts a direct influence on roll call voting. Instead, the influence of gender is manifested through ideology and party. Conclusion. The primary effect of gender on roll call voting is that it leads female legislators to make different choices in ideology and partisanship as compared to their male counterparts.},

	abstract = {Because it is associated with most multifactorial inherited diseases like heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and other serious medical conditions, obesity is a major global health concern. Obesity is caused by hereditary, physiological, and environmental factors, as well as poor nutrition and a lack of exercise. Weight loss can be difficult for various reasons, and it is diagnosed via {BMI}, which is used to estimate body fat for most people. Muscular athletes, for example, may have a {BMI} in the obesity range even when they are not obese. Researchers from a variety of backgrounds and institutions devised different hypotheses and models for the prediction and classification of obesity using different approaches and various machine learning techniques. In this study, a majority voting-based hybrid modeling approach using a gradient boosting classifier, extreme gradient boosting, and a multilayer perceptron was developed. Seven distinct machine learning algorithms were used on open datasets from the {UCI} machine learning repository, and their respective accuracy levels were compared before the combined approaches were chosen. The proposed majority voting-based hybrid model for prediction and classification of obesity that was achieved has an accuracy of 97.16\%, which is greater than both the individual models and the other hybrid models that have been developed.},
